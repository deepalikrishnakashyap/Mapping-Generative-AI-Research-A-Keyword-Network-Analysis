# Mapping-Generative-AI-Research-A-Keyword-Network-Analysis
This project explores the intellectual landscape of Generative AI research using Web of Science (WoS) publications. By analyzing keyword co-occurrence networks, we identify key research themes, track evolving trends, and uncover interconnections in the field of Generative AI.

# Overview

Generative AI is a rapidly evolving field, with research spanning multiple domains such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and ethics. Understanding the core themes and their interconnections is essential for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. This project aims to map the intellectual structure of Generative AI research using Web of Science (WoS) publications, leveraging keyword co-occurrence network analysis to identify key research areas and emerging trends.

# Background

The Web of Science (WoS) is a comprehensive academic database that enables researchers to explore the evolution of scientific disciplines. By retrieving Generative AI-related publications and analyzing author keywords, this project will visualize how different research themes interconnect. The study will employ network analysis techniques to determine influential keywords, cluster research topics, and predict future trends in Generative AI development.
Tasks
1. Literature Retrieval & Dataset Preparation

    Define search terms to systematically retrieve Generative AI-related publications from the Web of Science (WoS) database.

    Ensure search terms cover major topics like "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)", "Diffusion Models", "Text-to-Image Models", and "Ethics in Generative AI".

    Clean and preprocess retrieved data, filtering relevant metadata such as titles, abstracts, and author keywords.

2. Keyword Co-Occurrence Network Analysis

    Extract author keywords from the dataset to construct a co-occurrence network.

    Use network visualization tools (e.g., Gephi, NetworkX, or Cytoscape) to create an interactive representation of keyword relationships.

    Identify central and frequently occurring keywords using network metrics such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficients.

3. Identifying Key Research Themes & Trends

    Apply weighted network analysis to detect clusters of related research topics.

    Investigate the evolution of Generative AI research, highlighting emerging trends and potential future directions.

    Provide insights into how different themes (e.g., GANs, AI Ethics, Diffusion Models, AI for Creativity) interconnect.
